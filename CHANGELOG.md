# v0.7.1
*Released on 2026-03-09*

- added: **notebook allowlist** — pattern-based access control restricting AI to specific notebooks
  - gitignore-style patterns: exact names, `*` wildcards, `**` recursive, `!` negation
  - hierarchical access: allowing a parent grants access to all children
  - enforced across all tools: read, write, search, list, tag operations
  - generic error messages prevent leaking notebook details
  - configurable via JSON (`notebook_allowlist`) or env var (`JOPLIN_NOTEBOOK_ALLOWLIST`)
  - startup validation with logging and auto-creation of default notebook when allowlist resolves to zero
- added: E2E test suite (43 tests) running against a real Joplin instance in Docker
- added: `notebook_utils.py` module for path resolution, allowlist matching, and notebook map caching
